## 📖 Usage

Type `/drawnix` or `/whiteboard` or `/mindmap`, it will automatically create an image and open Drawnix for creation. After editing, it will be automatically saved as an image format (SVG/PNG), supporting secondary editing.

> ⚠️ Note: Currently, the secondary editing of images is implemented by writing drawnix data through custom block attributes. If the custom block attributes are deleted or modified, data may be lost and secondary editing will not be possible.

## ❤️ Support

If you like my plugin, please star the GitHub repository and consider supporting me via WeChat donation. This will motivate me to continue improving this plugin and developing new ones.

Maintaining plugins is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Personal time and energy are limited. Open source is just for sharing, not an obligation to spend my time implementing features that users need for free.

I will gradually improve features that I need (donations can speed up development). Some features that I think can be improved but are not necessary at this stage require donations to be implemented (will be marked with donation tags and required donation amount). Features that are not needed or too complicated to implement will be directly closed without consideration. PRs are welcome for features I haven't implemented.

Friends who have donated a total of 50 yuan and want to add me on WeChat can leave your WeChat ID in the donation note, or send an email to achuan-2@outlook.com for a friend request.
